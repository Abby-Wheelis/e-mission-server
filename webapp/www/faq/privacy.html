<h3>Introduction</h3>
The Can Do Colorado eBike Program aims to show participants and those they interact with the transformative power of an eBike as a transportation solution. It is our hope that program participants will use their new eBike as a regular part of their transportation routine.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
First and foremost participants are expected to use their eBike as their primary tool for getting to and from their places of employment or school. We also hope that the eBikes will be used for errands and other everyday trips, including:
<ul>
<li> ðŸš² grocery shopping
<li> ðŸš² trips to other stores
<li> ðŸš² visiting friends and family
<li> ðŸš² recreation
</ul>

This privacy policy outlines the details of why we collect data, what data we collect, how we limit data linkage and access to ensure your confidentiality.

<h3>Purpose</h3>
The data collected during the program will be used to understand how eBikes are used including when and how often as well as distance travelled. This data will be collected through the CanBikeCO app and will be used as we develop other related programs.

<h3>What we collect</h3>
By participating in this program, you agree to allow us to automatically track a number of metrics including your <b>location</b>, accelerometer, device-generated activity recognition, app usage time and battery usage. We will also ask that you enter your experiences and feedback during weekly surveys. 
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Furthermore, there will be an initial survey upon first launch of the application to collect information about your age, socioeconomic status, and health status. This information will never be made public or sold, and is collected directly by the Colorado Energy Office without commercial third party involvement.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
We use an open source platform, e-mission, for the data collection. You can inspect the data that e-mission collects in the background at <a href="https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-data-collection.git">https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-data-collection.git</a>, view the configuration for this pilot at <a href="https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone/tree/ceo_ebike_project">https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone/tree/ceo_ebike_project</a>, and see the automated analysis that we perform at <a href="https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-server/tree/ceo_ebike_project">https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-server/tree/ceo_ebike_project</a>

<h3>How we associate your data with you</h3>
Each participant will be given a token key for registering with the program. Only Colorado Energy Office and eBike Program support staff will have access to the relationship between the token key and the participant. The identity of participants will not be shared with anyone or any organization outside the Colorado Energy Office and eBike Program support staff.

<h3>Who gets to see it</h3>
Only limited Colorado Energy Office and eBike Program support staff will have access to the raw data. Data may be provided to approved outside organizations, however, any outside requests for data will be further anonymized through data aggregation.

<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
Data confidentiality is the highest priority with the State of Colorado. Your study data will be handled with the utmost care. To minimize risks to confidentiality, we will store data on a secure platform server. During the program, only limited Colorado Energy Office, your local program administrators, and the data collection team at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) will have access to the raw data. This access is always encrypted, and is restricted to specific IP addresses for greater security. While publishing or presenting program outcomes, individual names and other personally identifiable information will not be used nor will specific location trajectories from the trips be shared.

At the conclusion of the program, the data on travel patterns, de-linked from personal identifiers such as name or email, will be submitted to the Transportation Secure Data Center (TSDC), hosted at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The TSDC enables anonymous transportation data storage and analyses for understanding travel patterns, and the effectiveness of potential improvements. Travel Information anonymity will be preserved according to the procedures established by the Transportation Secure Data Center (TSDC).  More information on the TSDC can be found at <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/tsdc">https://www.nrel.gov/tsdc</a>, including details on <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146515002999">its data handling procedures</a>.
